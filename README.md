# The-Simon-Game

The Simon Game was originally inspired by the “Simon Says” and “Touch Me (arcade game)” games.

It was launched in 1978.

Here is a website similar to Simon Game made using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Vanilla JavaScript** and **jQuery**.

So go ahead and have fun playing with your friends. 😄😄
